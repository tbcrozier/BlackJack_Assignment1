Rendering Problems colorAccent doesnt have # : What is this?
My Emulator is restarting after ever run making testing slooow.

[David]
I have not had an issue with my emulator or with rendering.  
I am using api level 23 and everthing is updated to the newest version.
I did notice that the start page did not change.  Maybe i misread your comment.

[David]
I moved all the deck logic into a class and i will work on that until it was done.
I know i am moving around alot but im used to coding on the fly when i get an idea.
I will try to work on only one thing at a time.
If i find a decent casino font I will change it and you can tell me what you think.
I took your green background idea and changed it to an image.  
If we can get a decent font we might have something here.

[Blake]
The style activities are not complete, will continue working on them tomorrow night.
Programatically, i dont think our cards array needs to have as many images as it does. Since
suit does not matter, only number counts towards the score, we may be able to shorten the array
by only having 1 of each card. Thats just an idea, it may or may not be useful especially as
the png files are already loaded in the array. I will be occupied Sunday morning, but will
continue working on the activities in the afternoon.
