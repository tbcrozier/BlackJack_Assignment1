Rendering Problems colorAccent doesnt have # : What is this?
My Emulator is restarting after ever run making testing slooow.

[David]
I have not had an issue with my emulator or with rendering.  
I am using api level 23 and everthing is updated to the newest version.
I did notice that the start page did not change.  Maybe i misread your comment.

[David]
I moved all the deck logic into a class and i will work on that until it was done.
I know i am moving around alot but im used to coding on the fly when i get an idea.
I will try to work on only one thing at a time.
If i find a decent casino font I will change it and you can tell me what you think.
I took your green background idea and changed it to an image.  
If we can get a decent font we might have something here.
